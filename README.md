## Foundation Phase
> ⏱️ **Estimated Time: 4–8 weeks** | 🔴 Everything in this phase is Essential — do not skip.

### 1. Computer Fundamentals

---

#### Operating Systems 🔴 Essential
> ⏱️ 1–2 weeks

---

#### Linux Fundamentals 🔴 Essential
> ⏱️ 1–2 weeks

> 💡 **Why Linux before Networking?** Almost every networking tool you'll use — Wireshark, tcpdump, Nmap, netcat — runs from a Linux terminal. Learning Linux first means you can actually run and understand those tools when you hit the Networking section.

**⭐ START HERE — Step 1 (Free, Zero Linux Experience):** [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)
> If you have never used a Linux terminal, start here — not Bandit. Linux Journey is free, browser-based, and requires zero setup. Complete the **Grasshopper** section (about 2–3 hours). It covers the filesystem, basic commands, and permissions. Only after you can navigate the terminal confidently should you move to Step 2.

**⭐ START HERE — Step 2 (Free, After Linux Journey Grasshopper):** [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
> Now you're ready. Bandit is a game that forces you to apply Linux commands to hack through 34 levels. Don't look at walkthroughs until you've tried each level for at least 20 minutes. This teaches you more than any video — but it only works *after* you've learned the basics in Step 1.

- [Linux Command Line Basics](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) *(Free — official Ubuntu tutorial, good Step 1 alternative)*

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - Development environment management
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - Security-focused Linux distribution

**🏋️ Practical Exercises:**
- Install and configure a Linux distribution
- Master bash scripting for automation
- Set up a LAMP/LEMP stack
- Configure user permissions and security settings

**✅ Milestones — Can you do these?**
- [ ] Navigate the filesystem, create users, set permissions — all from terminal only

- [ ] Use `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `find`, and `chmod` confidently
- [ ] Complete OverTheWire Bandit up to Level 20+
- [ ] Set up a web server on a fresh Linux VM

---

#### Networking Basics 🔴 Essential
> ⏱️ 1–2 weeks

> 💡 **Why Networking after Linux?** You'll use `tcpdump`, `Wireshark`, `nmap`, and `netcat` throughout this section — all terminal-based tools. Having Linux under your belt means you focus on learning *networking concepts* instead of fighting the command line.
